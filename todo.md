# TODO

1. Set-up Mimir as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus
2. Create more examples
3. Create more helpers for the native Prometheus metrics
4. Update the write command in the terminal to accept a regex pattern so the exact path doesn't have to be specified (useful for deeply nested directories)
5. Check if meta can be optional in the `writeWithLog` function
6. Build in a way to assess what the results are for the log files (e.g. what percentage of results match a callback function)
7. Add an option to the api to reset the summary metrics
